						[MESSAGE]
						<br>
						<br>
						BugNET has file upload capabilities for attachments. These features require custom security settings so that the application 
						is able to create and remove files in your website.
						<br>
						<br>
						Using Windows Explorer, browse to the root folder of the website ( 
						C:\BugNET by default ). Right-click the folder and select Sharing and 
						Security from the popup menu ( please note that if you are using Windows XP you 
						may need to <a href="http://whoozoo.co.uk/winxpFilePerms.htm" target="new">Enable 
							Simple File Sharing</a> before these options are displayed ). Select the 
						Security tab. Add the appropriate User Account and set the Permissions.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>If using Windows 2000 - IIS5</b><br>
						- the {Server}\ASPNET User Account must have Read, Write, and Change Control of 
						the virtual root of your website<br>
						<br>
						<b>If using Windows 2003 - IIS6</b><br>
						- the NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE User Account must have Read, Write, and 
						Change Control of the virtual root of your website
